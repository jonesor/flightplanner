Description: Allows users to create flight plans for the 'Litchi' software
    using input data such as latitude and longitude of an origin point,
    dimensions and orientation of a survey array, drone camera field of
    view and desired altitude. It calculates the image footprint using
    this information and calculates the best position of photo survey
    points. It also provides the ability to visualize the resulting flight
    plan and survey photo grid.
