`flightplanner` allows users to create flight plans for the Litchi software using input data such as latitude and longitude of an origin point, dimensions and orientation of a survey array, done camera field of view and desired altitude. It calculates the image footprint using this information and calculates the best position of photo survey points. It also provides the ability to visualize the resulting flight plan and survey photo grid.

## Installation

You can install the development version of flightplanner like this:

```{r}
# install package 'remotes' if necessary
# will already be installed if 'devtools' is installed
install.packages("remotes")

# argument 'build_opts = NULL' only needed if you want to build vignettes
remotes::install_github("jonesor/flightplanner", build_opts = NULL)
```

## Usage

First remember to load the package.

```{r}
library(flightplanner)
```

To plan a mission (1) decide on an origin point latitude and longitude (e.g. 55.125505, 10.268467) This will be the lower left point of your image grid. Then decide on a horizontal (west-east) limit and a vertical (north-south) extent for your survey area. For example, from the origin to 200meters to the east, and 500meters to the north. Then decide on an altitude, say 60m (above the origin point). 

With this information you can make a plan:

```{r}
litchiGrid(
  55.125505,
  10.268467,
  altitude = 200,
  overlap_width = 0.50,
  overlap_height = 0.50,
  survey_xaxis = 30,
  survey_yaxis = 50)
  
```


## Note

WARNING: This package was developed for my own use and may contain bugs or errors. Please use caution when using it, and carefully check your plan using Litchi or Google Earth. The plans generated by this package are ignorant of landscape topology, trees, buildings and other structures, so please plan accordingly. The use of this package and the resulting plans are your responsibility. I hope that it can be useful, but use it at your own risk.
